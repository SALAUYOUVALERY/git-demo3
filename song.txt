It's such a warm place,
But there on the street,
Where our footprints are waited for,
Stardusted boots
Sparkle and shine.
Here are the shepherds and upholstered chair,
Dazzling dreams below the bright sun, orb,
The trigger untouched
When it was the right time.

My blood type mark is on the sleeve,
There's my ordinal number marked on the sleeve,
Wish me now some luck in the fight,
Sayin' now, sayin'!
I won't stay in this field of green,
I won't stay in this field of green,
Wish me now to be lucky,
Sayin' now, sayin'!
... Be lucky!
